## 🔧 **Key Features Implemented**

### 1. **Dynamic Additional Requirements**

```typescript
// Add new requirement
const addAdditionalRequirement = () => {
  setFormData((prev) => ({
    ...prev,
    additionalRequirements: [...prev.additionalRequirements, ""],
  }));
};

// Remove requirement
const removeAdditionalRequirement = (index: number) => {
  if (formData.additionalRequirements.length > 1) {
    setFormData((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      additionalRequirements: prev.additionalRequirements.filter(
        (_, i) => i !== index
      ),
    }));
  }
};
```

### 2. **Multi-Select Day Management**

```typescript
const handleDayToggle = (
  field: "partTimeWorkDays" | "remoteWorkPreferredDays",
  day: string
) => {
  setFormData((prev) => ({
    ...prev,
    [field]: prev[field].includes(day)
      ? prev[field].filter((d) => d !== day)
      : [...prev[field], day],
  }));
};
```

### 3. **Enhanced Job Display**

```tsx
{
  /* Licensed Candidate Preview */
}
{
  ((job.candidateType && job.candidateType.length > 0) ||
    job.workSchedule ||
    job.payStructureType) && (
    <div className="mb-4 p-3 bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg">
      <h4 className="text-sm font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-2">
        🎯 Licensed Candidate Opportunity
      </h4>
      {/* Dynamic content based on available data */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
