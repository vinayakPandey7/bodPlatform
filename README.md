## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd learning-project
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Environment Setup**

   Create `.env` file in the `server` directory:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/bod_service_portal
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here
   EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
   ```

   Create `.env.local` file in the `client` directory:

   ```env
   API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```

5. **Database Setup**

   Start MongoDB service and run the seed script:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run seed
   ```

6. **Start Development Servers**

   **Option 1: Start both servers simultaneously**

   ```bash
   # From the root directory
   npm run dev  # If you have concurrently installed globally
   ```

   **Option 2: Start servers separately**

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd server
   npm run dev

   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

## Default Login Credentials

After running the seed script, you can log in with these credentials:

- **Admin**: admin@bodportal.com / admin123
- **Employer**: employer@test.com / employer123
- **Recruitment Partner**: recruiter@test.com / recruiter123

2. Reusable components in `client/src/components/`
3. Custom hooks for state management in `client/src/hooks/`
4. API utilities in `client/src/lib/`

### Adding New Features

1. Define database models if needed
2. Create controller functions
3. Add API routes with proper middleware
4. Create frontend components and pages
5. Update navigation and routing

## Deployment

### Backend Deployment

1. Set up MongoDB Atlas or cloud MongoDB instance
2. Configure environment variables for production
3. Deploy to platforms like Heroku, Railway, or DigitalOcean

### Frontend Deployment
